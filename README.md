# Drag & Drop Mechanics Test

🎮 A simple Unity test project demonstrating drag-and-drop mechanics.

This repository contains a small Unity prototype that implements basic drag-and-drop interactions with objects in the scene.  
The goal is to show how interactive object movement can be handled in Unity using mouse/touch input.

## 🧩 Overview

This project focuses on:

- Basic drag-and-drop interaction
- Detecting objects under cursor/touch
- Updating object position during drag
- Releasing objects at valid drop targets

This is a **mechanics test**, not a complete game — its purpose is to show a small, working gameplay feature. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
